**Note:**
This a fork of the original project as it's no longer maintained.

## To do
- Figure out a way to build this into a executable for release, haven't been succesful at it... included a VBS script instead that launches the program if you have Python3 and the requirements installed
Make sure Python3 is installed properly and do **pip install -r requirements.txt** and then use can use **1fichier-dl.vbs** to launch

## Fork Features
- Fix looping bug when proxy works but download fails
- Allows to input custom proxy list via a URL in the Settings > Connection menu (example list: https://pastebin.com/raw/uVVLrxyd), should use HTTPS proxies
